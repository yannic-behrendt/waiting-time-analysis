# Waiting Time Analysis

This repository contains code for the master thesis "Waiting Time Analysis for Business
Processes Based on Event Data" by Yannic Behrendt.

## installing dependencies

To install the needed dependencies, recreate the conda environment

```Bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## generating input

To run, an event log and a performance analysis report generated by [https://github.com/AutomatedProcessImprovement/waiting-time-analysis/tree/caise2023](https://github.com/AutomatedProcessImprovement/waiting-time-analysis/tree/caise2023) are needed.
https://github.com/AutomatedProcessImprovement/waiting-time-analysis/blob/caise2023/tests/assets/PurchasingExample.csv can be used as a running example

## configuring

In [config](/src/waiting_time_analyzer/config.py) the names of the columns in the event log and performance analysis can be customized.

````python


````

## starting 

There are commandline options for filtering the event log and providing the input
```
  --event_log EVENT_LOG
                        Path to the eventlog file in xes or csv
  --performance_analysis PERFORMANCE_ANALYSIS
                        Path to the waiting time analysis
  --top_k TOP_K         filter the event log by top k most frequent paths
  --case CASE           filter the data by a specific case
```

Example command:
````bash
src\waiting_time_analyzer\main.py --event_log=/path/to/PurchasingExample.csv --performance_analysis=../path/to/PurchasingExample_report.csv --top_k=10
````
